Do not try this!

Forkbomb on bash

	:(){ :|: &};:

Explanation:

:() 		--> define a function called :

{ stuff } 	--> contents of the function :

:|: & 		--> Run : and feed its output to another : in the background. Essential forking step.

; 			--> command separator

: 			--> first execution of :


TO prevent forkbombs, set a hard limit on number of processes/threads that can be created by a non root user.

	sudoedit /etc/security/limits.conf

Add to bottom of this file

	* hard nproc nnn

where nnn is the limit you want to apply, typically around 1000 for a single user system.
